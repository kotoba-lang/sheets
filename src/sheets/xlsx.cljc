  "A workbook as a .xlsx.

  ## Where this lives, and why not in a library of its own

  `slides` writes .pptx in `slides.pptx` on top of `ooxml`, which supplies
  the OPC vocabulary — content types, relationships, the package — and
  nothing about presentations. The same division works here, and `ooxml`
  already anticipated it: `package-kind` returns `:xlsx` for an `xl/` prefix
  and `part-sort-key` knows how to order `xl/worksheets/sheetN.xml`. A
  `spreadsheetml` repository to hold what turned out to be one namespace
  would have been a repository for the symmetry of it.

  ## Every cell is written as text

  `<c t=\"inlineStr\">`, including one whose value looks like a number.
  `sheets.csv` refuses to guess on the way in for a stated reason — guessing
  is how a part number becomes a float — and writing is the same claim in
  the other direction. A workbook here holds strings because that is what it
  was given; deciding on its behalf that `0042` is forty-two, at the moment
  it leaves for Excel, would be the guess arriving late rather than not at
  all.

  Inline strings also mean no `sharedStrings.xml`: one part fewer, no string
  table to keep in step with the cells that index it, and a file Excel opens
  either way. A workbook large enough for the table to pay for itself is
  larger than anything this Drive produces.

  A formula cell writes `<f>` and no `<v>`. There is no evaluator in this
  library, so a cached value is not something it could write — Excel
  recalculates on open, which is the correct outcome and not a workaround.

  ## Reading meets more shapes than writing chose

  A .xlsx from Excel is not the one this namespace produces: its strings are
  in a shared table, its numbers carry no `t` at all, and its formulas come
  with the value Excel last calculated. The reader handles all of them and
  keeps the formula rather than the cached value — see `cell-value`.

  It also reads dates, which are not a type in Excel but a number under a
  format that says so. That means reading `xl/styles.xml`, and it is the one
  place this namespace converts rather than passing text through: `45000` is
  a number until the document says it is a day, and then it is
  `2023-03-15`. See the dates section.

  What it still does not read is anything about appearance — fonts, fills,
  widths, merges — because nothing in this model can hold them. A workbook
  that goes out through `xlsx-files` and comes back is the cells and the
  sheet names, and says so.

  ## Both hosts, actually run

  This is `.cljc`, and `clojure -M:test` exercises one host. `scripts/
  test-cljs.cljs` runs the same namespaces under nbb, because the first two
  bugs found here — `column-name` emitting control characters and
  `column-number` reading every column as 1 — existed only under
  ClojureScript and passed every JVM test."

  `:sheets/style` on a cell — colours, weight, number formats. Writing them
  would mean a `styles.xml` with a `cellXfs` entry per distinct style and a
  style index on every cell, which is a real piece of work and not one this
  Drive has needed. The reader already parses that part, for dates.

  `:sheets/named-ranges` — `definedName` entries in the workbook part.

  `:sheets/charts` — a chart part per chart, each with its own
