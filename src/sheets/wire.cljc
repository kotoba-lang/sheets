  "Transit wire helpers for Kotoba Sheets workbooks.

  ## Out is lossy, back is explicit

  `transit.core/write-json` is a projection onto plain JSON: keywords become
  bare strings, and every map key becomes a string — including the ones that
  were not strings to begin with. A workbook has two of those, and they are
  the whole reason this namespace needs a reader that knows the schema:

  - a cell address is `[1 1]`, and it comes back as the string `\"[1 1]\"`
  - `:sheets/type` is `:workbook`, and it comes back as `\"workbook\"`

  while a tab id, a named-range id and a cell's style keys are *supposed* to
  stay as they are. No generic keywordizer can tell those apart, which is
  why `rehydrate-workbook` lives here, next to the model that defines them,
  rather than in `transit` — the wire layer does not know what a workbook is
  and should not have to.

  `read-workbook-envelope` gives back the projection unchanged, for callers
  that only want to look at a value. `rehydrate-workbook` turns it back into
  a workbook the model and `sheets.validate` will accept."
