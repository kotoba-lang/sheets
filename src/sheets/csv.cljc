  "CSV in and out of a tab.

  A tab rather than a workbook, because CSV has no idea a workbook has more
  than one and pretending otherwise means inventing a convention — a sheet
  name in the first line, a file per tab in a zip — that nothing on the other
  end would agree with. One tab is what the format can carry, so one tab is
  what these take and return.

  ## RFC 4180, and the parts of it that matter

  A field is quoted when it contains a comma, a quote, a carriage return or a
  newline; a quote inside a quoted field is doubled. Reading accepts more
  than writing produces: bare CRLF or LF line endings, and an unterminated
  final quote is taken as ending at the end of input rather than throwing,
  because a truncated file should import as far as it goes and say what it
  got.

  ## What a cell becomes

  Text. Every value read from CSV is a string, including one that looks like
  a number, because CSV does not say and guessing is how a part number
  becomes a float. A caller that knows better converts.

  Writing is the mirror with one exception: a formula cell writes back as
  `=EXPR`, which is what a spreadsheet would show and what this library's own
  editor shows. There is no evaluation here — `sheets` has no evaluator — so
  a formula's *value* is not something this could write even if the
  convention said to."

  A formula goes out as its own text, `=SUM(B2:B9)`, rather than as what it
