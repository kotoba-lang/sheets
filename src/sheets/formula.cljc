  "What `=SUM(B2:B9)` comes to.

  A workbook here could hold a formula and never compute one. `sheets.xlsx`
  writes `<f>` with no cached value on purpose — Excel recalculates on open,
  which is correct — but inside this Drive a spreadsheet showed the text
  `=SUM(B2:B9)` for ever. Computing is the whole point of a spreadsheet.

  ## Nothing is stored

  `values` takes a tab and returns what each cell comes to *now*. A computed
  value written back into `:sheets/value` would be a second copy of something
  derived, stale the moment any input changed, and indistinguishable
  afterwards from a value somebody typed. The model holds formulas; this
  answers what they mean.

  ## Cells hold text, and that is not undone here

  `sheets.csv` reads every field as a string, and `sheets.xlsx` writes every
  cell as one, both for the same stated reason: guessing is how a part number
  becomes a float. So evaluation parses text to a number *where a number is
  required*, and says so when it cannot — it does not decide that `0042` was
  a number all along.

  Which follows Excel: `=A1+1` over text is `#VALUE!`, while `=SUM(A1:A9)`
  ignores the text in the range. The difference is that arithmetic asks for
  a number and an aggregate asks for the numbers there are.

  ## Errors are values

  `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, `#NAME?`, `#REF!`, `#CIRCULAR!` — a cell whose
  formula cannot be computed holds the reason, which is what a spreadsheet
  does and is more useful than an empty cell or a thrown exception. They
  propagate: a sum over a range containing `#DIV/0!` is `#DIV/0!`, because
  the alternative is a total that silently omits a number nobody can see is
  missing."
