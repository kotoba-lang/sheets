  Bijective base-26: there is no zero digit, so the usual division has to
  borrow one before each step. Getting this wrong gives a workbook whose
  27th column is `BA`, which Excel opens without complaint and reads wrong.

  The letter comes out of `alphabet` by index rather than out of arithmetic
  on a character code. `(int ch)` does not mean the same thing on both
  hosts — on the JVM a character is a `Character` and `int` is its code
  point; in ClojureScript it is a one-character string and `int` coerces it
  to 0 — so the arithmetic version silently produced control characters and
  read every column as 1 under cljs.

  This lives here rather than in `sheets.xlsx`, where it was, because
  addressing is not a fact about a file format. It was written twice and got
  the same bug both times."

  becomes row 5, so it now multiplies somebody else's number. Adjusting them
  is what a spreadsheet with a dependency graph does, and this does not have
  one — so the answer is no rather than a rearrangement that quietly
  computes something else.
